# ArkInventory Fork for Ascension

This is a fork of ArkInventory tailored for Ascension, based on the Cataclysm pre-patch version.

## About

ArkInventory is a powerful inventory management addon for World of Warcraft. This fork aims to adapt it for use with Ascension, addressing specific issues and adding new features as needed.

## Current Status

This fork is currently in development. While it's functional, there are some known issues that we're actively working on.

### Known Issues

1. **Personal and Realm Bank Functionality**
   - The Personal and Realm Bank features (which use the guild bank interface) do not work when the player is not in a guild.

2. **New Item Highlighting**
   - New Vanity and Cosmetic items are not being highlighted as expected.

3. **Localization Warnings**
   - Some warnings related to localization appear in the chat.

## Roadmap

Our primary focus is on resolving the above issues to ensure a smooth user experience. We're also open to community feedback for additional features or improvements.
